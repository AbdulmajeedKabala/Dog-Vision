# 🐶 Dog Vision - Image Classification with Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to classify dog breeds from images.  
The notebook **`dog_vision.ipynb`** walks through data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of dog breed image datasets  
- Transfer learning with pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  
- Training and fine-tuning for high accuracy on dog breed classification  
- Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy and loss curves  
- Visualization of predictions vs. ground truth

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Problem Definition**: Predict dog breeds given input images  
2. **Data Preparation**: Load, preprocess, and augment dataset  
3. **Modeling**: Train CNNs using transfer learning (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet, or similar)  
4. **Evaluation**: Measure model performance with accuracy and loss metrics  
5. **Prediction**: Generate predictions on new, unseen dog images
